# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The problem I was solving in the project was how to arrange, define, explan the comments and create the functions, the algorithms to sort the courses, the prerequisites in alphabetical orders in the ABCU.cpp file. The problem in the ABCU.cpp file was complexity. In the project two, it is required to make the arrangement in the sorting algorithms to compare the elements, characters and courses. The problem is how to make the function to swap two elements in the course list and arrange them. It is difficult to perform the while condition, comparision, for loop and other operation to print out the output in alphabetical orders. The problem is how to create the insertion for the sorting, the problem in the second project is making the additional sorting algorithm such as the bubble sort in the comparing the pairs of elements and swapping the order. 

# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

In order to approach the problem, I need to understand the requirements, properties and the specifications of the problems and the specifications, principles, definition of the sorting algorithms. I need to know where to apply the sorting algorthims and the sorting function. I need to figure out where to implement the differences in the rules of sorting the numbers and the characters. In order to approach the problem, the data structure is important to understand because  A data structure is a way to organize and store data. Good data stucture can help to perform the data effeciently. Arranging the array is one of the example of the data structure. It can store all the elements, numbers, course listm and good data structure can organized and store a large data such as integer, real number, logical, operation.
I approach the problem by implement and adapt the comparision function in the the ABUC.cpp file. 

# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

I overcome the roadblocks by reading books such as reading the algorithms of the sorting. I also do the debugging, correct errors when there are problems, if there are errors, I will analyze and identify and locate the errors, and I will fix the errors. If I encounter the roadlocks, I will break the source codes, problem into smaller pieces. In the second projects, it consists hundred of lines of code, and correcting the errors will be very difficult. Therefore, if I break the code into smaller part or divided the code into a group, and then the code will become very easy to modify. 

# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

This project expand my approach to design software and develope the program by when I was working in this project, it helps me to expand my problem solving skills, with the problem solving skills, I can think of as many solutions and methods as possible when I have problem with the code, I also develope the  time management skills , planning skills in developing program. 

I know how to find the data structure that represents the algorithm when I developing the future program. I can develope the data structure that be suitable for the operations of the algorithm. It is important to choose the appropriate algorithm and data structure, because the data structure will make the program perform faster.
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Working on this project evolved the way I write programs that are maintainabel, readabel and adaptable by after doing this project, I know how to write code in very clear format and I know how to and choose the right name, right variable to make the code a lot easier to understand. I develope the way to improve the name the function, I understand how to name the variables, functions, parameters, lists, classes, packages. I need to create a reasonable name for the files and the folder names that contain the code. The name will describe what is going on, the purpost of the the name, the name needs to explain what this code, the function is doing.

Working on this project help me to understand a set of general principles, criteria of writing code. I know how to define, represent and know to use white spaces, and I know how to indent the code in a right and in a logical way. According to my knowledge, I understand and define that It is important that  a line of code can not be more than eighty characters long. A small program can not have a function that contain more than thirty lines. According to my knowledge, a program can not execute a class that contain more than five hundred lines. The code will be in the same column together, the next line in the code will start at the same level as the line above. After working on this project, I know how to write comments, clean code because the clean code will make it easier for others to understand what the code is doing and clean code will minimize the errors.
